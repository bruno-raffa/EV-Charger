# EV-Charger
This section has been coded for performance on problems of the industrial scale supported by Leapâ€™s quantum-classical hybrid solvers.

The previous implementation was written for readability, this comes at the cost of speed.

In this version we will be skipping symbolic construction altogether, working directly with variable labels and a QM object.
